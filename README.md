| Operating System | Links |
|----------|---------|
| Ubuntu Linux | https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=20.04.2.0&architecture=amd64 |
| Arch Linux | https://archlinux.org/releng/releases/2021.02.01/torrent/ |
| Kali Linux | https://www.kali.org/downloads/ |

### REMINDERS
#### 1. I did not provide iso distributions for Windows and MAC OS because it is one of the most widely preinstalled operating systems alongside MAC OS. Personally, I am not a big Windows fan either, so...
#### 2. If you are using a Windows PC, be sure to disable "secure boot" in the BIOS settings. Be sure to look up your primary system's key instructions to enter boot menu/ bios environment
#### 3. When you burn your iso to usb disk, you should install [BalenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). This program automatically formats the usb disk to match the input iso. 
#### 4. For Arch Linux, instead of downloading the isos from mirrors in each respective country, I downloaded the torrent file and installed any free torrent file manager to unzip the torrent file.
