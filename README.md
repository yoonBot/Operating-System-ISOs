### REMINDERS
#### 1. I did not provide iso distributions for Windows and MAC OS because it is one of the most widely preinstalled operating systems alongside MAC OS. Personally, I am not a big Windows fan either, so...
#### 2. If you are using a Windows PC, be sure to disable "secure boot" in the BIOS settings. Be sure to look up your primary system's key instructions to enter boot menu/ bios environment
